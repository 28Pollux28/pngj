<p>
This package contains classes that are not apt for Google app-engine, 
because they reference some non-white-listed classes.
(eg: FileOutputStream).
<p>
These classes are non essential, and should be not included in the
restricted jar. 
</p>
<p>
Note: since March 2012 the FileHelper class that was here was moved to the main package/jar, so this package is
currently empty and can be ignored.
